## Commit Messages & Versioning

[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). In order to simplify the versioning
and release process, please be sure your commit messages adhere to the

You may wish to install the [commitizen/cz-cli](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)
to make this near-bulletproof.
